Assignment Instructions

Imagine you work at a Bitcoin exchange and you have customer information coming from another source: SSN, credit card and their bitcoin numbers. However, the file format is CSV and your exchange can only support JSON. Your task is to write a Node script to convert CSV into JSON.

You can download the customer information CSV file here: Link to download: customer-data.csv

A CSV file is like a table. It has the following structure in which the first line has the field names and the rest of the lines have the data:

id,first_name,last_name,email,gender,ip_address,ssn,credit_card,bitcoin,street_address
